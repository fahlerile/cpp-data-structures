# linked-list

A linked list class. Supports indexing with brackets, initializer-list initializing, adding and deleting elements, getting size and pretty-printing.

## TODO
- Add method to add new data to the beginning
- Change initializer-list initializing (iterate backwards over a initializer-list and prepending data to the root)
- Add ability to change values with bracket operator
- Add iterator(s)
- Add double-linked linked list as a subclass?
